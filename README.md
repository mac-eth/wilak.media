# A Next.js based Web App for Wilak Media

This webapp is a statically generated site using [Next.js][nextjs] for the frontend and [Sanity][sanity-homepage] to handle its content. It comes with a native Sanity Studio that offers features like real-time collaboration, instant side-by-side content previews, and intuitive editing.

The Studio connects to Sanity Content Lake, which gives you hosted content APIs with a flexible query language, on-demand image transformations, powerful patching, and more. You can use this starter to kick-start a blog or learn these technologies.

> **Note**
>
> This starter uses the `/pages` directory for Next.js routing.
>
> I'll migrate to the [/app][app-dir] directory
> when Vercel announce that it is production ready.
